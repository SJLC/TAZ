Every year: new gentoo ebuilds are downloaded and the tbz2's are updated
tbz2's are made and then stored at the github live cd project site (ecomputing/TAZ);
4 folders are placed herein:
* x86_tbz2's
* x86_64_tbz2's
* x86 bootable archives for livecd
* x86_64 bootable archives for livecd
old tbz2's (of previous years) are placed in subfolders of the x86_tbz2's and x86_64_tbz2's folders
The x86 bootable archives for livecd folder and the x86_64 bootable archives folder will both contain the 9 different bootable archives to be started at boot. The bootable archives will be squashfs archives.
Every year: a new live cd and different bootable archives are made using the tbz2's

Operating principles of the live cd:

The live cd will first show a first boot screen:
* log in as root
* log in as user (tux)
* install SliTaz to HD

Next, a second boot screen is shown, displaying the 8 different boot options, knowingly:
Boot setup 1: core programs only
Boot setup 2: core programs + system-config-printer + abiword + gnumeric
Boot setup 3: core programs + impressive
Boot setup 4: core programs + inkscape
Boot setup 5: core programs + GIMP
Boot setup 6: core programs + alsaplayer
Boot setup 7: core programs + mpv
Boot setup 8: core programs + Claws mail
this technique is similar to http://doc.slitaz.org/en:guides:manyinone
after selecting one of these options, it will copy all data of this setup option (core programs= 1 compressed file, additional programs = 1 additional compressed file) to RAM (tmpfs) and then boot this setup. The benefit of this approach is that the amount of RAM needed for the PC can remain relatively low, and the operating system will also be much faster

Read/write abilities:
Since the cd-r is read-only, the operating system never changes and can't become insecure.
Upon boot, the data is written to ram (--> it will copy the archives to tmpfs so it runs from RAM), hence allowing the introduction of settings (for example to add log-in data to gajim, data for printer detection, ... so these can effectively be used). This login data will need to be entered every time the operating system is restarted, as settings are not storable. The browser will similarly lose all its history data with every restart, but during use, it will keep history data.
Any important data generated (i.e. text documents, spreadsheets, powerpoint presentations, ...) can be saved to a usb stick. 

Notes:
When the distro is installed to HD, the boot screen it will show will be different, knowingly:
* log in as root + persistence
* log in as user (tux) + persistence

If no persistence is wanted for a particular computing session, the user can simply use the livecd instead (rather than starting the distro installed to the HD).
