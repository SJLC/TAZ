This package would be an add-on and modify feh (so it can be used as a
screensaver, see https://jamcnaughton.com/2014/09/05/simple-slideshow-screensaver-script-for-ubuntu/
).

It would retrieve images from /images on any usb device (you might want to install autoFS for this in advance)

When this folder is then filled up with images by the user, it would
automatically show these screenshots after say 5 minutes (this should
also be settable via command line).

The feh screensaver program would be active in the background, from
the moment the computer has been started (or rather after the user
enters X).

xprintidle may be needed
