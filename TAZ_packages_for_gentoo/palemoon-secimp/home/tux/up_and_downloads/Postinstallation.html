<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Now that the script has all ready made your internet use more efficient (by blocking unnecessary internet connections 
   and avoiding loss of surfing speed and personal time), we should do some extra changes to ensure that additional safety can be ensured.
   These changes mainly involve changing your DNS and locking it, stop using regular (non-SSL) search engines,
   for example by no longer visiting these websites directly, but instead by only using the new
   SSL-search bar now added to your browser, using a passwords and user name reminder list, and backing up your 
   google e-mails and google drive (if you use these) by using <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/100458?hl=en">Google Takeout</a>.
   The same goes for any other similar IMAP services (like hotmail, ...). You can then save this personal
   data on a USB stick or an external harddisk. You can continue to use your Google e-mail account; 
   the idea is just that if the account gets hacked, or you lose your password, you just don't lose your data.</p>

<h2>Changing your DNS server</h2>

<p>
	Changing your DNS server is one of the most important things to do. By default, it will be set to the DNS servers of
	your internet service provider (ISP). You best change it to a DNS server located in a neighbouring country. 
	This because if you set it to a DNS server located further away, there might be a significant reduction of your surf speed. 
	If you don't find any DNS servers in the list below that are located in your vicinity, you could also look up the DNS servers 
	of another ISP in your own country -with whom you don't have an internet access account-, and change it to those (if this is allowed by this ISP).
	Note also that you will appear to be a national of that country you used a DNS server of when surfing btw, which could be useful if you
	want to access certain web content (i.e. news videos, ...) that is blocked in the country you live in.<br /><br />
	To change your DNS server, open the file "resolv.conf" located in /etc/, with an editor like Geany, Gedit, ...<br />
	Next, change the 2 IP numbers listed by 2 numbers listed below.<br />
	Then, lock this file (even to root) to prevent DHCP clients of changing it again.<br />
	Do this by typing "chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf" at the terminal. <br />
	Note that if you ever need to be able to change it again, just type "chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf"

<h2>Making a passwords and user name reminder list</h2>
<p>
	Perhaps suprisingly, but the largest threat of losing access to web services, e-mail accounts, ... comes not
	from hackers, ... but from you yourself. At a time when web admins all over the world are pushing for using
	more difficult/complicated passwords (which combine letters and numbers and require a minimum of a certain amount of
	characters), the best way to prevent you losing access to your accounts is by using simpler passwords (as simple as
	allowed by the web admins) yet using different ones for every web service and by keeping a text file with all your 
	passwords and user names per web server (which we call a "passwords and user name reminder list").<br />
	The best place to store such a text file is on an external drive (USB stick or external hard disk), and having this 
	drive connected only when you really need it (preferably when you don't have an active internet connection). If you
	really want, you can make this text file password-protected by using a tool such as keepassx.<br />
	Then, for the user names and passwords you should use: the reason why we advocate simpler passwords is because, all
	though you now have a passwords and user name reminder list (and you can theoretically thus use very complex passwords and
	user names, the idea isn't that you keep the external drive the file is on continuously connected, so you can't use it to 
	"peek" into it and copy/paste the data herein (for example into your browser, when you surf to your web service). 
	Rather, you can only write it it over to a piece of paper and keep this besides your computer instead (to peek to this 
	and type it over manually), or you just learn it by head. Often, it might still be easiest to just know it out of your head, 
	and then more simple passwords and user names are easier to remember; also, they're faster to type in. <br /><br />
	
	Experience has learned, that using long/difficult passwords and user names aren't that much safer, due to
	the danger of losing such passwords and user names, and then no longer remembering them as they're so difficult and because
	hackers have more chance of finding your user name and password by trying out old passwords and user names they might of
	acquired from you and which you used on other web services (and which you are continuing to use on new, other services) rather
	than the chance they have of finding it via brute-force attacks (against which, more complicated user names and passwords indeed
	offer more protection).<br />
	So, besides using simpler passwords user names, just make sure you use different passwords and user names for each web service you use,
	and keep all these in the passwords and user names reminder list. If need be, you can keep using a same user name
	with all your web services (just make sure it isn't your real name) and even just vary the passwords per web service marginally (i.e. 
	if you use the password "kft123", you can use "kft456" for example on a different web service.
</p>

<h2>Updating Pale Moon, adding plugins and displaying content</h2>
<p>
	Pale Moon has been set to no longer automatically update, since updating it might result in compatibility problems 
	with the plugins added, causing them to no longer function, and thus fail in protecting you. You can change this temporarily in 
	Pale Moon, if you are sure that updating won't cause compatibility problems with the plugins, for example if new versions 
	of the plugins have come out, or if the Pale Moon update is known not to cause compatibility problems.<br /><br />
	
	Regarding the adding of new plugins: this is still possible, but make sure you temporarily disable the "User agent overrider" 
	plugin before you visit the Pale Moon extensions page. Else, it won't work (at least not if you chosen a different user 
	agent as your current browser with the User agent overrider button in Pale Moon; which is something you best do btw for 
	regular surfing).<br /><br />
	
	For surfing to/using certain websites, you may need flash and/or javascript capability. This is blocked currently 
	by the noscript plugin. So to re-enable it, you must disable the noscript plugin temporarily (when not necessary, 
	re-enable noscript as it is an essential security element).<br /><br />
	
	Note that if you need flash for viewing certain youtube video's, embedded in websites, you can also use mps-youtube 
	(start it using the "mps-youtube" command) in "Run program"). On the webpage's source (just right-click 
	in Pale Moon, and select "View Page Source"), you should be able to find the details to find and run the same video in 
	mps-youtube. This method thus allows you to circumvent the process of disabling/enabling noscript, and it's also much 
	safer, as the mps-youtube does not use flash, and there are, as such, no security risks involved with this method, 
	whereas when you disable noscript, and then run the youtube flash-applet, there certainly are.  
</p>

<h2>Using other programs connecting to the web</h2>

<p>
	The script has only made Pale Moon safer to use. Any other browsers or other programs you normally use
	are hence unaffected by the script and will remain equally safe/unsafe as before. It is hence advised that you no longer
	use any other browsers.<br />

	An alternative to Claws and/or Thunderbird (installed on your hard drive) is to use a portable windows e-mail client like 
	<a href="http://www.pendriveapps.com/koma-mail/">Koma Mail</a> or <a href="http://www.pendriveapps.com/sylpheed/">Sylpheed (run with Wine)</a> on your external drive
	you should all ready be using to store your e-mails on.<br /><br />
	
	Regardless of the method and e-mail client used, at least make sure you have an off-line e-mail client and a POP3 e-mail account, to
	be used alongside any IMAP services (like Google Mail, Hotmail, ...) you might still be using. <br /><br />
	
	If you also want to add an (unsecure form of) encryption to your e-mails, for example to prevent spiders of reading and collecting data from your e-mails 
	in an automated way, you can add a plugin like <a href="https://code.google.com/p/zillo/zillo">zillo</a> to Gedit or <a href="http://plugins.geany.org/geanypg.html">GeanyPG</a> 
	to Geany (installed with the apt-get install geany-plugin-pg command). Note that the last one (GeanyPG) is rather complicated to use as it requires a key pair (rather 
	than just a single password) and setting up everything is also not straightforward (you'll need to use the terminal to make the key pair, ...). One alternative to using off-line 
	programs is to use a web tool like <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/135638/the-best-free-ways-to-send-encrypted-email-and-secure-messages/">SafeMess.com</a>. The idea is that you then write your e-mail 
	in the offline-program, or in the web tool, then copy/paste text into your e-mail, and put the password and the encryption method used in the subject header (which is the part of the message 
	that is not encrypted). Obviously, any human can open this, but it should prevent spiders of reading the mails, which could result in much less spam arriving in your e-mail. 
	Besides using direct encryption of text, there's also the option of just making a text file, encrypting that with a file encryption tool (like 
	<a href="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~nulifetv/freezip/freeware/">dsCrypt (run with Wine)</a> or <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a>, Vim (using the vim -x filename.txt command), mcrypt (using 
	the mcrypt and mcrypt-d command, openssl (using the openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file.txt -out file.out, and openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in file.out command), and then 
	sending this as an annex in your e-mail, and putting the password and encryption method used anywhere in your e-mail (doesn't matter whether it's in the subject header 
	or the actual content, as the mail itself isn't encrypted at all anyway). <br /><br />

	Regardless of the encryption method used, do make sure that (if you use encryption), that the person you sent your encrypted e-mail to knows how to open/read it.
	With the text encryption, this would mean the person would need to be made aware in advance that he has to copy/paste the encrypted text in Geany or Gedit (with the GeanyPG/zillo plugin)
	and then unencrypt it using the password and encryption method specified in the subject header. With the file encryption method, he would need to know he has to unencrypt it with
	dsCrypt (run with Wine) or Vim, again with the password and encryption method specified in the (unencrypted) e-mail message. As such, this still means that you can't use encryption on
	all the mails you sent (most of which may be people you don't know and/or had no prior contact with).

<h2>How were the the settings automatically altered in the Pale Moon browser ?</h2>

</p>
    For developers, it might be useful to know how the Pale Moon browser with modified settings was made (the moddified settings contains settings also stored in the config files -like all.js, prefs.js, palemoon.js, vendor.js, ... 
    The settings were automatically changed by a script placed in /usr/local/palemoon/defaults/pref/<br />
    This method allows use of newer versions of Pale Moon as well (in which case, just replace the Pale Moon folder with the newer Pale Moon version and move over the settings file). 
    Note that just uncompressing the omni.ja file to be able to edit the js files directly could have also been done but not have allowed using updated Pale Moon versions, and would also have been a hassle. This, as you'd then
    needed to use a de-optimizer tool (ActivePython and optimizejars.py), and repack the omni.ja file, re-optimize the file, ... See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/About_omni.ja_%28formerly_omni.jar%29">here</a> 
    and <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/edit-files-inside-firefox-4-omni-jar-to-auto-save-password/">here</a>. Even if I were to have succeeded in this, it would then also have been a hassle to find all 
    the settings in the .js files, and with every new palemoon version, one needs to re-update the palemoon version anyway, since the .js files could be changed since the latest palemoon version 
    as well (so it has exactly the same problem as the low-tech method I used).<br />
    Anyway, for developers that want to make their own similar Pale Moon version, feel free to use the modified settings file available in the folder noted above. Unlike the original settings 
    of the security guide, it has been made a bit less restricted to still allow a (limited form of) the history feature in palemoon. Other changes are the altered download location and the 
    disabling of the automatic palemoon update (to avoid problems with the extensions added).
