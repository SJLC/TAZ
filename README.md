# TAZ
Plain gentoo linux which has its packages pre-compiled (binary packages -tbz2's-) and made available at the TAZ github site.
Two versions of the tbz2's are made, knowingly x86_tbz2's and x86_64_tbz2's.
The bootable images (livecd's) -made from the tbz2's- are also spiced with some extra (TAZ) packages
