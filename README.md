# TAZ
This is the gentoo-version of TAZ, not the slitaz-version of TAZ (the latter is available via sourceforge).
It is a plain gentoo linux which has its packages pre-compiled (binary packages -tbz2's-) and made available at the TAZ github site. Two versions of the tbz2's are made, knowingly x86_tbz2's and x86_64_tbz2's.
The bootable images (livecd's) -made from the tbz2's- are also spiced with some extra (TAZ) packages. 
Besides the addition of some extra packages, the TAZ livecd's also differ from the official x86 and x86_64 gentoo livecds by being rather small (able to fit on a cd) while still having full livecd functionality (so not just an install cd).
