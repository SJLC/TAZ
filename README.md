# TAZ
This is the gentoo-version of TAZ, not the slitaz-version of TAZ (the latter is available via sourceforge).
It is a gentoo linux livecd/liveusb iso which is compiled for x86 and x86_64.
The TAZ livecd's differ from the official x86 and x86_64 gentoo livecd's by being
rather small (able to fit on a cd) while still having full livecd functionality (so not just an install cd).
The binary packages -tbz2's- are also made available at the TAZ github site. 
Two versions of the tbz2's are made, knowingly x86_tbz2's and x86_64_tbz2's.

Extra packages for gentoo (that change TAZ into SecuriTAZ) can be found at https://github.com/ecocomputing/gentoo-overlay
