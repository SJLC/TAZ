Every year: new ebuilds are downloaded and tbz2's are updated
tbz2's are made and then stored at github live cd project site;
4 folders are placed herein:
* x86_tbz2's
* x86_64_tbz2's
* x86 bootable archives for livecd
* x86_64 bootable archives for livecd
old tbz2's (of previous years) are placed in subfolders of the x86_tbz2's and x86_64_tbz2's folders
The x86 bootable archives for livecd folder and the x86_64 bootable archives folder will both contain the 9 different bootable archives to be started at boot. 
Every year: a new live cd and different bootable archives are made using the tbz2's

Operating principles of the live cd:
the live cd will first show a boot screen and display 8 different boot options, knowingly:
Boot setup 1: core programs only
Boot setup 2: core programs + system-config-printer + abiword + gnumeric
Boot setup 3: core programs + impressive
Boot setup 4: core programs + inkscape
Boot setup 5: core programs + GIMP
Boot setup 6: core programs + alsaplayer
Boot setup 7: core programs + mpv
Boot setup 8: core programs + Claws mail
this technique is similar to http://doc.slitaz.org/en:guides:manyinone
after selecting one of these options, it will copy all data of this setup option (core programs= 1 compressed file, additional programs = 1 additional compressed file) to RAM and then boot this setup. The benefit of this approach is that the amount of RAM needed for the PC can remain relatively low, and the operating system will also be much faster

Read/write abilities:
Since the cd-r is read-only, the operating system never changes and can't become insecure.
Upon boot, the data is written to ram, hence allowing the introduction of settings (for example to add log-in data to gajim, data for printer detection, ... so these can effectively be used). This login data will need to be entered every time the operating system is restarted, as settings are not storable. The browser will similarly lose all its history data with every restart, but during use, it will keep history data.
Any important data generated (i.e. text documents, spreadsheets, powerpoint presentations, ...) can be saved to a usb stick. The computers hard disk (which will often contain a different operating system, like MS Windows, ...) won't be made accessible nor will there be write access to it. This ensures that the user can't corrupt his other operating system from the live cd.
