# This file tells the system to look for (and execute) the keymap.sh file in the folder /bootscripts/ on any USB device 
# (in practice, only USB sticks should be used). Automounting is available (due to AutoFS), so any connected USB sticks will
# automatically be searched for the indicated file/folder. If no such file is found on any USB device, the keymap in this file 
# will be used instead.
